# Projectile Lab Guide — Educator

## Teaching Goals

- Connect component vectors to launch parameters.
- Contrast constant horizontal velocity with accelerated vertical motion.

## Facilitation Tips

- Ask learners to sketch the predicted trajectory before running the sim.
- Use the gravity slider (Educator+) to show how different worlds behave.

## Discussion

- Why does range depend on both speed and angle?
- How would air drag reshape the trace we see here?
