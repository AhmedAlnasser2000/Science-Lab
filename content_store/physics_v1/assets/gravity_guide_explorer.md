# Gravity Lab Guide — Explorer

## Experiment Ideas

- Switch between kernel and Python fallback (shown in the lab header) and compare the timing.
- Adjust `dt` aggressively to see when the simulation becomes unstable.

## Data Challenges

- Capture time/height pairs at fixed intervals and graph them externally.
- Estimate gravitational acceleration by fitting the results.

## What If

- Imagine stacking two labs: what happens when you combine horizontal motion?
- How could you extend this to include elastic collisions with different bounce factors?
