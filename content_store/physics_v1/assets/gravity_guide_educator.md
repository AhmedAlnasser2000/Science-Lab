# Gravity Lab Guide — Educator

## Objectives

- Reinforce constant acceleration concepts using a single-body model.
- Encourage learners to link numerical labels with the visual canvas.

## Facilitation Notes

- Vary the timestep slider to discuss numerical stability.
- Ask students to predict the time to impact before pressing **Start**.
- Toggle between kernel and fallback modes if available to discuss precision.

## Discussion Prompts

- Why does the velocity remain negative after impact in the data table?
- How would air resistance change the curves we see here?
