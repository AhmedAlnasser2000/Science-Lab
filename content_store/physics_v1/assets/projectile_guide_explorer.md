## Experiments

- Enable reduced motion to compare trace-on vs trace-off performance.
- Sweep launch angles from 15° to 75° and record the maximum range.

## Data Hooks

- Export position/time pairs manually and compare with analytical solutions.
- Compute the theoretical hang time and validate against the simulation clock.

## Extensions

- Modify gravity to simulate launches on the Moon or Mars.
- Imagine layering wind gusts or spin—what new data would you need?
