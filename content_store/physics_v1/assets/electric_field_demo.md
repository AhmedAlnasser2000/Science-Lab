title: Electric Field Lab
---

This lab lets you explore how charge and distance affect electric field strength.

- Adjust the charge and distance, then press **Step** to recalculate.
- Use **Run** to animate slow updates (reduced motion stays gentle).
- Try positive and negative charges to see direction changes.
