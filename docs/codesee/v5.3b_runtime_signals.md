# Code See V5.3b Runtime Signals

Purpose: expand live activity coverage with runtime_bus signals and multi-dot trails,
while keeping persistence lightweight and bounded.

## Bridged bus topics

Jobs
- job.started -> span.start (node via job_type)
- job.progress -> span.update (no trail by default)
- job.completed -> span.end

Content install
- content.install.request -> activity event (system:content_system)
- content.install.progress -> span.update (system:content_system)
- content.install.completed -> span.end

Core cleanup
- core.cleanup.started -> span.start (system:core_center)
- core.cleanup.completed -> span.end

Run storage + cleanup
- core.storage.allocate_run_dir.request -> activity event (system:core_center)
- core.runs.delete.request -> activity event (system:core_center)
- core.runs.prune.request -> activity event (system:core_center)
- core.runs.delete_many.request -> activity event (system:core_center)

Install/uninstall requests
- core.content.module.install.request -> activity event (system:content_system)
- core.content.module.uninstall.request -> activity event (system:content_system)
- core.component_pack.install.request -> activity event (system:component_runtime)
- core.component_pack.uninstall.request -> activity event (system:component_runtime)

Errors
- error.raised -> app error event (system:app_ui)

## Pulse trails

Bus activity emits a base event plus a short multi-dot trail:
- trail kind: codesee.pulse.trail (transient)
- trail count: 3 dots, spaced ~70 ms
- dot travel + arrival fade use the existing Pulse Settings

Trail events are transient (not persisted), so snapshots/activity files stay compact.

## Persistence

Recent events + active/recent spans persist per workspace:
- data/workspaces/<id>/codesee/activity_latest.json

This allows Code See to show activity even if it was opened after the event occurred.
