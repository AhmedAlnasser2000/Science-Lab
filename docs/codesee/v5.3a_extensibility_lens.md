# Code See V5.3a: Extensibility/Dependencies Lens

This note describes the new deep drill-down hierarchy and the Extensibility/Dependencies lens.

## Deep drill-down hierarchy

Atlas now supports nested subgraphs:

- Pack -> Block -> Subcomponent -> Artifact

What this means in practice:

- Pack nodes expose a subgraph containing their Blocks.
- Block nodes expose a subgraph containing Subcomponents (Implementation).
- Subcomponent nodes expose a subgraph containing Artifacts (manifest and assets when available).

Graph IDs are stable and Windows-safe (sanitized for layout persistence).

## Extensibility/Dependencies lens

Lens title: "Extensibility/Dependencies"

Primary intent:

- Show where extensions live (Packs, Blocks, Labs).
- Show dependency relationships (provides/depends/loads).

Nodes shown:

- Workspace, Pack, Block, Subcomponent, Artifact, Lab, Extension, Plugin, System.

Edges shown:

- contains
- provides
- depends
- loads
- consumes

## Inspector metadata

Nodes may include metadata that surfaces extension points:

- `declared_by`: source registry or manifest origin
- `pack_id` / `component_id` / `lab_id`
- `manifest_path` or `pack_root`
- `dependencies`: list of node ids this node depends on

This metadata appears in the Inspector under "Extensions & Metadata".
