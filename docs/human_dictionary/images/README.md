# Human Dictionary Images

This folder is reserved for future visuals that support the Human Dictionary.

Planned workflow:
- A Gemini/Codex docs pass can add diagrams or simple explanatory cards here.
- Keep captions short and beginner-friendly.

Naming guidance:
- Use kebab-case names, e.g. `lens-vs-peek.png`.
- Keep names tied to dictionary terms for easy lookup.

Caption guidance:
- One sentence: what the image shows.
- One sentence: why it matters in PhysicsLab.
