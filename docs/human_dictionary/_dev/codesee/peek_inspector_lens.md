# CodeSee: Peek, Inspector, and Lens

## Peek mode
- **Meaning (plain English):** Quick focus into one part of the graph.
- **Real-life analogy:** Opening a folder to see only what is inside.
- **In PhysicsLab:** Narrows the visible graph to a selected subgraph.
- **Example:** Peek into a pack node to view internal dependencies only.
- **Common confusion (what it's NOT):** Not a permanent graph rewrite.

## Inspector
- **Meaning (plain English):** Detailed panel for one selected item.
- **Real-life analogy:** Product details page after clicking a catalog item.
- **In PhysicsLab:** Shows node/edge metadata, status, and related signals.
- **Example:** Open inspector for a node to see active badges and links.
- **Common confusion (what it's NOT):** Not the same as changing lens/filter.

## Lens
- **Meaning (plain English):** A predefined way to view/filter information.
- **Real-life analogy:** Camera mode presets (portrait, night, panorama).
- **In PhysicsLab:** Atlas/Platform/Content/Bus/Extensibility viewpoints.
- **Example:** Switch to Bus lens to focus on message flow entities.
- **Common confusion (what it's NOT):** Not a single-node detail popup.
