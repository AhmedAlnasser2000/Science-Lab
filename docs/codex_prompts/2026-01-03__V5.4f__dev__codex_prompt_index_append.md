# 2026-01-03 — V5.4f — dev — Codex prompt index append + workflow guardrails

**Model: GPT-5.2-Codex (Medium)**  
**Why this model/effort:** This is docs-only workflow hygiene (small, low-risk edits). Medium effort is plenty.

## Goal
1) Make `docs/codex_prompts/INDEX.md` the single source of truth for prompt docs:
   - Every prompt doc under `docs/codex_prompts/` must be logged in `INDEX.md` (date, version, filename, one-line purpose, and **commit hash after merge**).
2) Backfill `INDEX.md` entries for the most recent prompt docs that exist but may not be logged yet:
   - `2026-01-03__V5.4d__pillars__ui_view_and_run.md`
   - `2026-01-03__V5.4e__pillars__ui_polish_and_hygiene.md`
3) Add a short “Definition of Done” note near the top of `INDEX.md` that future prompts must:
   - be saved under `docs/codex_prompts/`
   - append an entry to `INDEX.md` in the same PR
   - update the commit hash field after merge (or leave as `TBD` in-PR and fill it post-merge in a follow-up PR if needed)

## Touchlist
- `docs/codex_prompts/INDEX.md` (required)

Optional (only if it improves usability, otherwise skip):
- `docs/codex_prompts/TEMPLATE.md` (a tiny copy/paste entry template)

## Forbidden list
- Do **not** change runtime code, CI workflows, tests, or tool logic.
- Do **not** add or modify GitHub Actions, packaging, or dependencies.
- Do **not** run git commands. Just edit files and describe what to commit.

## Notes / expectations
- Keep `INDEX.md` format consistent and easy to scan (table is fine).
- If you don’t know the final merge commit hash yet, put `TBD` and leave a note that it must be updated after merge.

## Self-verify
- Ensure `docs/codex_prompts/INDEX.md` renders cleanly (no broken table formatting).
- Confirm the two V5.4d/V5.4e prompt docs are present in the index.
- Confirm there are no unrelated file changes.

## Git checkpoint (user will run)
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "docs(V5.4f) codex prompt index workflow rules"`
- `git push`
