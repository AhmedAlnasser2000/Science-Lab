# GPT-5.2-Codex (Medium)
Justification: Small-to-medium multi-file UI polish + docs hygiene. No deep refactor; medium effort is enough and cheaper.

## Goal
Polish the new “Pillars” segment in System Health and reduce developer confusion around reports + venvs, without changing core architecture.

## Touchlist
- app_ui/system_health.py (Pillars segment UX polish)
- tools/pillars_report.py (small helpers if needed for UI formatting; keep backwards compatible fields)
- tools/pillars_harness.py (only if needed for better exit codes / clearer output; keep current CLI stable)
- docs/dev_setup.md (add short “venv is local only” + cleanup guidance)
- .gitignore (ensure .venv*, .venv312, .pytest_cache, __pycache__ are ignored)
- docs/codex_prompts/INDEX.md (append an entry for this prompt file)

## Forbidden list
- No changes to kernel/, runtime_bus/, core_center/ APIs
- No new third-party dependencies
- Do NOT modify .github/workflows in this step
- No large refactors / renames / moving directories

## Requirements
1) Pillars UI polish (System Health)
   - Show “Last report” path + last modified time (human readable).
   - Add a small filter toggle: [All] [Fail only] (default All).
   - Make status visually obvious using simple text badges (PASS/FAIL/SKIP).
   - If no report exists yet, show a friendly empty state with one button: “Run pillars checks”.

2) Actions
   - “Open report folder” (opens folder containing the JSON)
   - “Copy JSON path” and “Copy summary to clipboard”
   - Keep existing “Run pillars checks” background behavior; ensure button disables while running and re-enables on completion/failure.

3) Dev hygiene docs
   - In docs/dev_setup.md add a short section:
     - venvs are local dev-only and should not be committed
     - how to delete/recreate venv
     - note CI uses Python 3.12 but local may differ; recommend local 3.12 for consistency

4) .gitignore
   - Ensure patterns cover: .venv/, .venv312/, .pytest_cache/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, .python/

## Self-verify (must run)
- python -m compileall app_ui diagnostics tools
- python -m pytest -q tests/pillars
- python tools/pillars_harness.py --out data/roaming/pillars_reports_smoke
- Launch app: python -m app_ui.main
  - System Health → Pillars: verify empty state works, run button works, report loads and filter works.

## Manual tests (tell user)
- Open System Health → Pillars
- Click “Run pillars checks” and confirm UI doesn’t freeze
- Verify “Open report folder” opens Explorer
- Toggle Fail-only filter and confirm list changes
- Confirm git status is clean (no venv tracked)
