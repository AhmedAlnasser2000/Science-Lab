# Pillars test scaffold (V5.4)

This folder holds the early pillars verification harness. Only lightweight checks are implemented now; most pillars are intentionally skipped until concrete requirements land.

TODOs for future milestones:
- Add real storage/runtime integrity checks.
- Validate inventory / registry consistency.
- Exercise workspace content round-trips once stable APIs are available.
